## Workflow

### Sales Process
1. Customer order is received via **e-commerce**, **phone call**, or **in-store purchase**.  
2. Sales orders are created through the Sales app, or products may be sold directly through the **POS system** (for walk-in or anonymous customers).  
3. If the product is stocked:  
   - A **delivery order** is generated.  
4. If the product requires manufacturing:  
   - A **manufacturing order** is triggered.  
5. Once delivery/manufacturing is complete:  
   - An **invoice** is generated.  
6. **Invoice settlement** and payment reconciliation is performed.  

### Manufacturing Process
- Manufacturing orders move required components from **inventory to production lines**.  
- If stock is insufficient:  
  - A **purchase order** is automatically created for replenishment.  
- Quality checks and approvals are required before final delivery.  

### After-Sales & Support
- **Warranty and repair management** for defective or returned products.  
- **RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization)** process for customer returns.  
- Tracking of **spare parts** for repair and maintenance.
