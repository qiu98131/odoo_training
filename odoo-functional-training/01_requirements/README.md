# Business Requirements  

This folder contains the **detailed business requirements** of the simulated company **Zalino Tech**, which serves as the foundation for the Odoo Functional Training project.  

Each file in this directory represents a **business function, service, or department** of Zalino Tech, outlining their operations, workflows, and automation needs.  
These requirements are later mapped to Odoo modules in the [`02_Modules_Scope/`](../02_module_scope/README.md) folder.
