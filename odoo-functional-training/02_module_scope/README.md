## ðŸ“Œ Closing Remarks  

This module scope serves as a **blueprint** for mapping Zalino Techâ€™s business requirements to Odooâ€™s applications.  
By aligning each business process with the right Odoo module, we ensure:  

- âœ… **Clarity** â€“ Each requirement is traceable to its supporting module.  
- âœ… **Consistency** â€“ Standardized processes across branches and operations.  
- âœ… **Scalability** â€“ The system can grow with the companyâ€™s needs.  
- âœ… **Training Effectiveness** â€“ Learners gain real-world experience through structured, scenario-based practice.  

This structured scope will guide the upcoming **day-wise training sessions** (see `03-Training_Daywise`) and ensure a smooth transition from requirements to practical Odoo solutions.
