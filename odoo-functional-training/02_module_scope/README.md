# Module Scope

This folder contains the **overall mapping of Zalino Techâ€™s business requirements to Odoo modules**.  
It acts as a bridge between the **companyâ€™s needs** (documented in [`01-Requirements/`](../01_requirements/README.md)) and the **training exercises** (documented in [`03-Training_Daywise/`](../03_training_daywise/README.md)).  

Each file here describes the **scope of automation**, listing the relevant Odoo applications and how they support different processes of the company.
